# Facial Recognition Project

## Overview
This project implements a facial recognition system using Python. It utilizes deep learning techniques to identify and authenticate individuals based on their facial features. The system can perform real-time facial recognition, making it suitable for applications such as access control, surveillance, and attendance management.

## Features
- **Real-time Face Recognition:** Detects and recognizes faces in video streams.
- **Deep Learning-Based Approach:** Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction.
- **High Accuracy:** Achieves commendable accuracy in identifying individuals.
- **Scalability:** Can be expanded to include more individuals in the recognition dataset.

## Methodology
The project follows these key steps:
1. **Dataset Preparation:** A diverse dataset of facial images is collected, comprising individuals from various backgrounds, ages, and genders.
2. **Preprocessing:** Images are preprocessed to ensure uniformity through face detection, alignment, normalization, and resizing.
3. **Feature Extraction:** Key facial features are extracted using CNNs.
4. **Model Training:** The extracted features are used to train a machine learning model.
5. **Testing and Evaluation:** The model is tested using separate data to evaluate its performance.

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need to install the following Python packages:

```bash
pip install flask opencv-python dlib face-recognition
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/facial-recognition-python.git
cd facial-recognition-python
```
2. Run the facial recognition script:

```bash
python facial_recognition.py
```
3. The script will start capturing video from your webcam and recognize faces based on the provided dataset.

Implementation Details
Libraries Used:
OpenCV: For image processing and face detection.
face_recognition: For feature extraction and face recognition.
NumPy & Pandas: For data manipulation.
Dlib: For visualizing results and performance metrics.
Script Flow:
The script captures video from the webcam, processes the frames, and compares detected faces with known faces in the dataset.
